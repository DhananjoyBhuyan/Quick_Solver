# NOTE: This is only for linux, and will not work on other operating systems.
# Make sure you have `python3` installed.
## Python version I made it on: 3.12.7
# Download the `quick_solver_installer.sh` file, then open your terminal and run the following to install the game:-
```bash
bash /path/to/quick_solver_installer.sh
```
### if you see a ❌ mark on the app icon on your desktop screen.
#### That means you chose the option for the game icon to appear on your desktop:
1. Go to your desktop screen, right-click on the game icon, then click "Allow Launching".
2. And then right-click on it again, click on "Properties", then find the "Enable running as a program" or "Executable as a Program" or something like that, it might be on the "Permissions" tab or in some other tab based on your version and os settings and themes. And the button's name might differ as well, but it will be something like "Allow........" or "Enable......." or "Executable....".
3. Make sure it's enabled.
4. (Optional step to be sure that the game works) Now open a terminal window and run `chmod 755 ~/Desktop/quick_solver.desktop` or `chmod +x ~/Desktop/quick_solver.desktop`.
# If nothing works:
## just run `python3 ~/.Quick_Solver/quick_solver.py` in your terminal and diagnose the issue yourself(if you can) or ask anyone who knows python or chatGPT, Deepseek, Claude, Perplexity, etc.
