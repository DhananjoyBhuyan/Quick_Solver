# NOTE: This is only for linux, and might not work on other operating systems.
# Download the `quick_solver_installer.sh` file, then open your terminal and run the following to install the game:-
```bash
bash /path/to/quick_solver_installer.sh
```
### if you see a ‚ùå mark on the app icon on your desktop screen.
#### That means you chose the option for the game icon to appear on your desktop:
1. Go to your desktop screen, right-click on the game icon, then click "Allow Launching".
2. And then right-click on it again, click on "Properties", then find the "Enable running as a program" or "Executable as a Program" or something like that, it might be on the "Permissions" tab or in some other tab based on your version and os settings and themes. And the button's name might differ as well, but it will be something like "Allow........" or "Enable......." or "Executable....".
3. Make sure it's enabled.
4. (Optional step to be sure that the game works) Now open a terminal window and run then run `chmod +x /home/YourUserName/Desktop/quick_solver.desktop` . Replace `YourUserName` with your actual home directory username.

##### if it still doesn't work, you might be having some problem with your linux OS(Operating System) or your Linux or the version of your linux is very different from the ones that are mostly used these days (e. g. Ubuntu jammy-jellyfish 22.04, Ubuntu noble-numbat 24.04.2, etc).
