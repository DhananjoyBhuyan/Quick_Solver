What's new in v1.1.8 (fully stable, tested, and ready for use!)

- Division questions are now smarter! Difficulty scales across levels â€” no more easy division in higher levels!
- The installer has changed, and some persistent files were updated in the source.

 Instead of updating like before, please:
1. Open your File Explorer
2. Delete the old installer file
3. Download the new installer file (like before)
4. Run it again. That's it!
