What's new in v1.1.8!!
Now, the division questions won't be easy in different levels, the difficulty of the division questions will also change, earlier division had the same difficulty in different levels.


This time things have changed: -
This time we have changed the installer file and also some files which are persistent accross updates, So instead of saying yes below, just go to your "File Explorer" delete the old installer file, then download the new installer file just like you did before and run it. PLease!
