What's new in v1.2.1 (ready to use)
Actually, versions v1.1.9 and v1.2.0-stable have bugs, so you need to update the whole thing, including the installer file. The bugs are fixed in v1.2.1.

BIGG UPDATE!!
-Added Badges feature which gives you bagdes based on your performance!!

But instead of updating like before please:
1. Go to your file explorer.
2. Delete the old quick_solver_installer.sh file.
3. Download and run the new one(Just like you downloaded before)
You can also download it by running the following command in your terminal:

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DhananjoyBhuyan/Quick_Solver/quick_solver_installer.sh && bash ./quick_solver_installer.sh

Make sure you had deleted the old installer before downloading the new one.
And done!! No extra steps needed.

And this time, just write down your progress somewhere, because this time, you will loose your progress, but if you want to play a bug free better version, then you need to loose your progress and username once. PLease!! Once, please!! It's important!
