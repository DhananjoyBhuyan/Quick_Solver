What's new in v3.6.0!!
AWESOME UPDATE!!
You have a "Delete Account" button now!! If you created a dummy account or created by mistake, you can delete'em now!!!
And now the text box inputs support much more and behave perfectly like real textbox from a website!!
New things added(which you could not do before):
Cursor movement and navigation: You can move the cursor through the text using arrow keys.
Delete key support: You can press delete key to delete a character.
