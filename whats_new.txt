What's new in v1.2.0-dev (under testing, buggy)
Actually, your current version v1.1.9 also has a bug, so you need to update a little later, so in the v1.2.0 the bug is being fixed and is under testing.

BIGG UPDATE!!
-Added Badges feature which gives you bagdes based on your performance!!

But instead of installing like before please:
1. Go to your file explorer.
2. Delete the old quick_solver_installer.sh file.
3. Download and run the new one(Just like you downloaded before)
You can also download it by running the following command in your terminal:

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DhananjoyBhuyan/Quick_Solver/quick_solver_installer.sh && bash ./quick_solver_installer.sh

Make sure you had deleted the old installer before downloading the new one.
